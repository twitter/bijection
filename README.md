## Bijection [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bijection.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bijection)

A Bijection is an invertible function that converts back and forth between two types, with
the contract that a round-trip through the Bijection will bring back the original object. Moreover,
the inverse has the same property.

Many Bijections are supplied by default. Use the `Bijection` object to apply Bijections that are present implicitly:

```scala
scala> Bijection[Int, java.lang.Integer](42)
res0: java.lang.Integer = 42
```

Sometimes, we can map onto a larger space for which the inverse is not well defined over all inputs
in that space. Consider `Int -> String`. The set of Strings that are minimal representations of Ints
is well defined, but not all Strings are in this set. To handle this, we mark types with `@@ Rep[T]`
to show that they are the image of some other set:

```scala
import com.twitter.bijection._

scala> Bijection[Int, String @@ Rep[Int]](100)
res0: com.twitter.bijection.package.@@[String,com.twitter.bijection.Rep[Int]] = 100

scala> Bijection.invert[Int, String @@ Rep[Int]](res0)
res1: Int = 100

scala> res0.isInstanceOf[String]
res2: Boolean = true
```
Notice that `@@ Rep[Int]` is a marker that this special subclass of `String` is a representation
of an Int (needed to make this a bijection).  To create instances of such a restricted type:

```scala
scala> import Rep._
import Rep._

scala> "10".toRep[Int]
res3: Option[com.twitter.bijection.package.@@[java.lang.String,com.twitter.bijection.Rep[Int]]] = Some(10)
```

Use `invert` to reverse the transformation:

```scala
scala> Bijection.invert[Int, String @@ Rep[Int]](res2)
res4: Int = 100
```

If you `import Bijection.asMethod` you can use `.as[T]` to do the default bijection to `T`:

```scala
scala> import com.twitter.bijection.Bijection.asMethod
import com.twitter.bijection.Bijection.asMethod

scala> 1.as[java.lang.Integer]
res0: java.lang.Integer = 1
```

Bijections can also be composed. As with functions, `andThen` composes forward, `compose` composes backward.

This example round-trips a long into a GZipped base64-encoded string:

```scala
scala> val bijection = Bijection.long2BigEndian andThen Bijection.bytes2GZippedBase64
bijection: com.twitter.bijection.Bijection[Long,com.twitter.bijection.GZippedBase64String] = <function1>

scala> bijection(123456789L)
res8: com.twitter.bijection.GZippedBase64String = GZippedBase64String(H4sIAAAAAAAAAGNgYGBgjz4rCgBpa5WLCAAAAA==)

scala> bijection.invert(res8)
res9: Long = 123456789
```

When you have bijections between a path of items you can `Bijection.connect` them:

```scala
scala> import com.twitter.bijection.Bijection.{asMethod, connect}
import com.twitter.bijection.Bijection.{asMethod, connect}

scala> import com.twitter.bijection.Base64String
import com.twitter.bijection.Base64String

scala> implicit val string2Long2Bytes2B64 = connect[String @@ Rep[Long],Long,Array[Byte],Base64String]
string2Long2Bytes2B64: com.twitter.bijection.Bijection[String,com.twitter.bijection.Base64String] = <function1>

scala> "243".toRep[Long].get.as[Base64String]
res0: com.twitter.bijection.Base64String = Base64String(AAAAAAAAAPM=)

scala> res0.as[String @@ Rep[Long]]
res1: String = 243
```

## Supported Bijections

Bijection implicitly supplies Bijections between:

* all numeric types <-> their boxed java counterparts
* all numeric types <-> big-endian `Array[Byte]` encodings
* all numeric types <-> String
* Bijections for all `asScala`, `asJava` pairs provided by [scala.collection.JavaConverters](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/JavaConverters$.html)
* String <-> utf8 encoded bytes
* `Array[Byte]` <-> `GZippedBytes`
* `Array[Byte]` <-> `Base64String`
* `Array[Byte]` <-> `GZippedBase64String`
* `Array[Byte]` <-> `java.nio.ByteBuffer`
* `Class[T]` <-> String
* `A => B` <-> `C => D` (function conversion)
* Bijection builders for all tuples. (`(String,Int)` <-> `(Array[Byte], java.lang.Integer)` is built automatically, for example.)

Additionally there is a method to generate Bijections between most of Scala's built in types:
```Bijection.toContainer[Int,String,List[Int],Vector[String]``` returns
```Bijection[List[Int], Vector[String]```

If you see a reversible conversion that is not here and related to types in the standard library
of Java or Scala, please contribute!
